<DATELINE>    CLEVELAND, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ohio Mattress Co said its first
quarter, ending February 28, profits may be below the 2.4 mln
dlrs, or 15 cts a share, earned in the first quarter of fiscal
1986.
    The company said any decline would be due to expenses
related to the acquisitions in the middle of the current
quarter of seven licensees of Sealy Inc, as well as 82 pct of
the outstanding capital stock of Sealy.
    Because of these acquisitions, it said, first quarter sales
will be substantially higher than last year's 67.1 mln dlrs.
    Noting that it typically reports first quarter results in
late march, said the report is likely to be issued in early
April this year.
    It said the delay is due to administrative considerations,
including conducting appraisals, in connection with the
acquisitions.

<TITLE>STRIKE THREAT, LOWER TRAFFIC MAR SEAWAY OPENING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jane Arraf, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 20, Reuter - </DATELINE><BODY>The St. Lawrence Seaway, set
to reopen March 31 after the winter, faces another tough year
because of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of the
first strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes, seaway officials
said.
    Depressed grain exports, rising costs, and competing modes
of transportation are all expected to result in only a marginal
increase over last year's traffic levels -- and revenues -- on
the 2,300 mile waterway, officials said.
    In 1986, a season that ran from April 3 to December 27, the
seaway moved 37.6 mln metric tons of freight between Montreal
and Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln tons on the Welland Canal,
linking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.
    By comparison, in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveled
through the Montreal-Lake Ontario section and 42 mln through
the eight-lock canal.
    The waterway is expected to lose 9-10 mln Canadian dlrs
this year, about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal
1986-87 ending March 31, said William Blair, an executive
member of Canada's St Lawrence Seaway Authority.
    The seaway moves about one-half of Canada's exported grain.
Those exports of the single most important commodity carried on
the waterway have been depressed by world surpluses.
    The Seafarers' International Union, which represents about
2,300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts, has said
it will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers'
demands for wage rollbacks and other concessions.
    "It's 99.9 pct (certain)--I guarantee you a strike," Roman
Gralewicz, head of the Seafarers' Canadian branch, has said.
    The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliator
to try to hammer out a contract agreement between the two
sides. The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on
the Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic.
    "We haven't had a strike on the seaway for years...a
prolonged strike would have a disasterous effect," Seaway
Authority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said.
    "These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the
St Lawrence Seaway," George Miller, vice-president of the
Canadian Lake Carriers Association, an association of major
Canadian shipping companies, said recently.
    The workers' current contract expires May 31. The
association said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages
for the next three years, reduced crew levels and the power to
restructure crew dispatching.
    The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs
(U.S.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and
freight rates and increasing competition. The seaway said 1985
was its worst year in two decades.
    Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on
the Welland Canal by eight pct this year, compared to last
year's 15 pct rise, while maintaining a freeze on tolls
throughout the rest of the waterway.
    Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway's 15 locks and
about 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs.
    "We may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but we
won't see a major increase for a number of years," Hemsley said.
    A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippers
in Western Europe should result in some increased traffic this
season but the full benefits won't be felt for several years,
Blair said.

the long-term banks every month.
    The latest bank debentures, at 4.6 pct, have met strong

interest rates, dealers said. The current 5.5 pct prime rate
has been in effect since February 28.

<TITLE>CITROEN EXPECTS HIGHER PROFITS, HELPED BY AX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NICE, France, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Automobiles Citroen expects rising
sales of its new AX compact car to help boost profits
significantly this year, continuing a financial recovery after
six straight years of losses, president Jacques Calvet said.
    Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AX
sports model, he said: "All the budgetary forecasts that we have
been able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvement
in 1987, compared with 1986," he added.
    Citroen, part of the private Peugeot SA &lt;PEUP.PA> group,
increased its share of the French new car market to 13.7 pct in
first two months 1987 from 12.1 pct a year earlier. It is
aiming for an average 12.8 pct share throughout the year after
11.7 pct in 1986.
    The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of the
European market, excluding France, to 3.2 pct this year from
2.9 pct in 1986.
    "Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet the
demand," Calvet said. "This is a relatively new problem for us."
    Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cut
the deficit to 400 mln in 1985, helped by moves to modernise
its range and improve productivity.
    Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen's 1986
profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs.
    This weekend he said that those profit estimates "remain
about the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic."
    Some of this optimism is due to the early success of the
AX, launched on the French market last October. It will be
available throughout most of western Europe within four months.
    The car has registered just over 20,000 sales.
    It is being built at Citroen's large plant at Aulnay-sous-
Bois in northern Paris, as well as at Rennes in Brittany and
Vigo in Spain, with production just reaching target level of
1,000 cars a day.
    The car, which Citroen markets as an intermediate model
between its long-running 2CV and the Visa, is designed to
compete with the Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa.
    The AX had built up its market share in France to around
four pct last month. Calvet said: "Our hope is that once the AX
is fully developed, we will have between 6.5 and seven per cent
of the national market."

<TITLE>VW AFFAIR COULD DELAY SHARE SALE - STOLTENBERG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg was quoted as saying a possible currency fraud at
Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> may affect government plans to sell its
20 pct stake in the carmaker this year.
    "It is all very unpleasant for us because we have decided to
privatise the VW shares this year. We will now have to ask
ourselves the question whether we can keep to this date," he
told Bild am Sonntag newspaper in an interview.
    Bild am Sonntag released the text ahead of publication
    Stoltenberg did not elaborate on the share sale. The West
German government owns 20 pct of VW ordinary share capital and
has said previously it plans to sell it either in 1987 or 1988.
    Stoltenberg told Bild am Sonntag the possible fraud showed
there had "clearly been reprehensible criminal conduct below the
level of the responsible management board."
    "I do not want to prejudge results but the immediate and
serious question which poses itself is whether certain
management board members have kept their areas of business
under appropriate control," he was quoted as saying.
    VW said last week it had discovered possibly fraudulent
currency transactions which could cost the company 480 mln
marks and had asked state prosecutors to investigate.
    It said on Friday it had dismissed the head of its foreign
exchange department, Burkhard Junger.
    VW also said it suspended six staff, including financial
transfer department chief Guenther Borchert and the head of the
central cash and currency clearing department, Siegfried
Mueller.

<TITLE>VW CURRENCY LOSSES SEEN INVOLVING SEVERAL TRADERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Allan Saunderson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The extraordinary foreign exchange
loss of 480 mln marks reported last week by Volkswagen AG
&lt;VOWG.F> (VW) is so large that outside currency traders were
probably involved in the case, currency sources said.
    They were commenting after weekend newspaper reports that
prosecutors were transferring the focus of their enquiries to
Frankfurt, West Germany's main foreign exchange centre.
    Volkswagen announced last Tuesday that it had called in
prosecutors to investigate a possible fraud involving currency
hedging.
    The newspaper Welt am Sonntag said the investigation by
state prosecutors was now considering whether the alleged VW
currency manipulators had outside banking accomplices.
    The transactions were only possible, "because the culprits
possessed genuine bank forms, with the help of which they were
able to deceive controllers for years," the newspaper said.
    But currency sources said there were so many loopholes in
every bank's currency dealing system that controls could easily
be avoided.
    Rolf Selowsky, financial member of the management board,
has resigned in the wake of the affair, a VW spokesman said.
    Selowksy's resignation followed a VW announcement on Friday
that foreign exchange chief Burkhard Junger had been dismissed
and Guenther Borchert, head of the financial transfer
department, had been suspended along with Siegfried Mueller,
head of the central cash and currency clearing.
    Four other members of the foreign exchange staff were also
suspended, but no charges have been laid.
    VW Supervisory board chairman Karl Gustaf Ratjen said
entire data tapes had been erased and programs altered in
forged transactions.
    Der Spiegel magazine said VW financial controllers
discovered the uncovered positions on February 18 when VW
expected a currency forward contract with the Hungarian
National Bank to mature, but Hungarian bank officials said they
knew nothing of the transaction and the supposed contracts were
forgeries.
    The Budapest-based bank refused to buy the dollars and has
not commented on the affair.
    The Hungarian National Bank is, along with the Soviet Bank
of Foreign Trade, one of two major East Bloc currency traders
and most major banks based in Germany deal with it regularly.
    It would not be possible, the sources said, for any bank to
renege on a genuine forward contract since this would
immediately become known and effectively prevent the bank from
operating further in the spot or forward currency markets.
    Longer-maturity forward contracts, even contracts of up to
10 years, were now becoming more common, they said but the
longer and larger the contract, the more likely it was that it
would be transacted with a domestic institution.
    Being one of Germany's most diversified multi-nationals, VW
has exposure in a large number of currencies and dealt in these
with most banks in Frankfurt and also abroad, sometimes through
currency brokers, although it has the reputation of doing
relatively little hedging, currency sources said.
    "They (VW) are always in the market, more or less trading as
a bank," one senior dealer said.
    Some newspaper reports said the losses were incurred
because of VW's failure to take out currency hedging contracts
beginning at the end of 1984, when the dollar was rising.
    But the currency sources said market speculation was that
dollar income of around one billion dlrs was involved and that
the bulk of the transactions occurred last year since which
time around 50 pfennigs per dollar was lost when the dollar
fall continued.
    Longer-maturity currency contracts for more than 100 or 200
mln dlrs each were rare. Taking several in this size out with a
single bank would be easily spotted by financial controllers.
    One senior dealer for a German bank said, "There's no way
they can have hoped to get away with it. It's too big."
    The sources added that the involvement of the Federal
Criminal Office (BKA) in Wiesbaden could indicate that the
investigation would lead outside Germany.
    BKA has the mandate to handle criminal cases that may
involve foreign police forces or supranational services such as
Interpol. However the branch also handles cases that transcend
federal state borders within Germany.
